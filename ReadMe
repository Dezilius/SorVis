------------------------ SorVis ------------------------

  This program will show you how certain sorting algorithms work.
  I tried my best, to visualize how algorithms work step by step.
  In addition I will add more explanations and tooltips how to use them.
  MergeSort has been implemented iteratively.
  
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Random Error occurs while using MergeSort !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  It occures less often after last patch but still happens from time to time.
