------------------------ SorVis ------------------------

  This program will show you how certain sorting algorithms work.
  I tried my best, to visualize how they (algorithms) work step by step.
  In addition I will add more explanations and tooltips how to use them.
  All algoruthms that can work recursively (MergeSort done, QucikSort not yet), have been implemented iteratively.
